Using the uVision and Proteus platforms, I implemented a room thermostat project. I used the LM35 sensor to detect the temperature and the 8051 microcontroller to change the temperature according to certain limits. The voltage given by the sensor was processed using ADC0808. 
The programming languages used are C and ASM. For more details I attached the report describing this project.
